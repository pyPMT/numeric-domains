# Settlers

Introduced by Maria Fox and Derek Long in IPC-3. The Settlers domain is one of the benchmark domains from the deterministic track of IPC-3 and IPC-4. It is based on resource-management games, in which resources must be accumulated and used to construct new resource centres, with new specialized production and capabilities. The resources (e.g. timber, stones, ore) can be extracted and combined to construct vehicles (carts, trains and ships), facilities (e.g. sawmill, coalstack, ironworks), and housing in different locations.
