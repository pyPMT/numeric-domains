# farmland

The FARMLAND domain models allocating manpower to farms, with a hard constraint on a metric measuring benefit. The contribution of each farm to the benefit is a function of the number of workers assigned. Each farm requires at least one worker. The number of workers ranges from 100 to 1,000, and the number of farms from 2 to 10. The experimental setting has been conceived to stress numeric reasoning.
