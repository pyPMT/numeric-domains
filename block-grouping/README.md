;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;; A number of blocks of different colours lie on a grid-like environment.
;;; The objective is to group the blocks by colour, i.e. to have all blocks
;;; of the same color in the same cell, which is at the same time
;;; different to the cell where blocks of other colors are:
;;;
;;; forall i, j color(i) = color(j) <=> loc(i) = loc(j)
