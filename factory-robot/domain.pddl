;; Factory Robot Domain
;;
;; A team of robots works in a factory with specialized stations. Each robot
;; has an energy reserve, accumulates workload (completed tasks), generates
;; heat while working, and can switch between production modes.
;;
;; Robots move between stations along a connected network. Each station can
;; hold at most one robot at a time. Stations have specialized equipment:
;;   - Charging stations: have chargers for energy recharge
;;   - Cooling stations: have coolers for temperature reduction and
;;     calibration equipment for post-turbo recalibration
;;   - Assembly stations: general-purpose work areas
;;
;; Each robot has fixed characteristics (capacity, work-cost, max-temp,
;; efficiency) that vary per unit. Working consumes energy and generates
;; heat; robots must manage their energy by visiting charging stations and
;; their temperature by visiting cooling stations. Production mode
;; (low/medium/high/turbo) controls the output rate for bulk work. After
;; turbo-work, robots must recalibrate at a calibration station before
;; performing regular or precision work.
;;
;; The objective is to reach a target workload for each robot while keeping
;; temperatures within safe limits.
;;
;; Numeric grounding features exercised:
;;   1. Ceiling freezing — energy assigned to constant capacity
;;   2. Floor freezing — workload only increases
;;   3. Multi-assign freezing — production set to 4 constant values
;;   4. Directional widening — temperature both increases and decreases
;;   5. Pruning via frozen ceiling — overcharge needs energy > capacity
;;   6. Pruning via frozen multi-assign — overdrive needs production > max mode
;;   7. Constant fluent references — work-cost, cooling-power in effects
;;   8. Interval arithmetic — workload * efficiency in preconditions
;;   9. Numeric goal checking — goals on workload and temperature
