# Repository of Numeric Planning Benchmarks

[SNP] Simple Numeric Planning domains only use increase and decrease with constants, and have linear conditions.
[LNP] Linear Numeric Planning domains add the possibility of using linear combinations of variables on the effects and also the assign operation.
[SDAC] State-Dependant Action Costs are domains where the cost of the actions depend on the state they are executed in.
[CE] Conditional effects.
