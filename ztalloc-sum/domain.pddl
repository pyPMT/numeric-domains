; Ztalloc: Reversed Collatz
;
;   Original author: Christian Muise
;
;   Summary: A numeric domain for the reversed Collatz problem, where the objective is to start from 1 to reach a target number n.
;            Either of the reversed Collatz operations can be applied at each step, and the goal is to minimize the number of steps.
;
;            The original Collatz problem is to start with a number n and apply the following operations until you reach 1:
;            - If n is even, divide it by 2.
;            - If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
;
;            In this reversed version, we start with 1 and try to reach some arbitrary number. No restrictions are
;            placed on the intermediate values, and the goal is to minimize the number of steps taken to reach 1.
;
;            Solutions are guaranteed to exist, assuming the Collatz conjecture holds. The author personally thinks this is
;            probably the case ;).
;
;   IPC Edit: The original domain was modified to accommodate multiple numbers to be combined together in order to reach a given target
